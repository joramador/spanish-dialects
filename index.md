# Spanish Dialect Predictor

## Project Description
I will focus on training neural networks (NNs) to predict the dialect of Spanish from a given input. It will prompt for a phrase in Spanish then the NN will use any key words and phrases within the phrase to predict what dialect it is. A new dataset will need to be created by using articles from different regions and will be 

The trained NN will be will be given different inputs of different dialects to test the prediction of three dialects.  If all goes well, then we will extend the NN's range and hopfully include more dialects.

The longer-term goal is to use a NN to enable better navigation in complex environments for a robot with multiple modes of locomotion (i.e., wheeled and flight). The results from this work will feed into an on-going project where we are trying to “cross the reality gap” that exists between simulation and the real world.


## Project Goals
- Create a dataset to train NN
- Train NN to predict the dialect of Spanish from input
