# Spanish Dialect Predictor

## Project Description
I will focus on training neural networks (NNs) to predict the dialect of Spanish from a given input. It will prompt for a phrase in Spanish then the NN will use any key words and phrases within the input to predict what dialect it is. A new dataset will need to be created by scanning articles/webpages/texts from different countries.

The trained NN will be given different inputs of different dialects to test the prediction of three dialects from three countries.  If everything goes well, then we will extend the NN's range and hopefully include more dialects from different countries.

The longer-term goal is to use a NN to predict the dialect from a wide variety of Spanish inputs accurately. The results of this work will hopefully enable future projects to predict dialects more specific to different regions within a country and dialects in other languages. Also, hopefully these results will enable work using audio instead of text as inputs to predict the dialects.


## Project Goals
- Create a dataset to train NN
- Train NN to predict the dialect of Spanish from input
- Set a foundation for future dialect prediction NNs
